    "Suppose you wanted to participate in a paper-airplane competition, and you want to use what you know about the phugoid model to improve your chances. For a given value of $L/D$ that you can obtain in your design, you want to know what is the best initial velocity and launch angle to fly the longest distance from a given height.\n",

    "*  Assume $L/D$ of 5.0 (a value close to measurements in Feng et al. 2009)\n",
    "*  For the trim velocity, let's take an average value of 4.9 m/s.\n",
